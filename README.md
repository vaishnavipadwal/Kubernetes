# Kubernetes

## What is kubernates
Kubernetes is an open-source container managment platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Why kubernates is used:
When you run applications in containers (like Docker), managing them manually can be complex. Kubernetes makes it easier by:
- Automatically managing container lifecycles
- Scaling applications up or down based on demand
- Load balancing traffic between multiple containers
- Self-healing by restarting failed containers
- Rolling updates without downtime

## Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster is a group of machines (nodes) that work together to run and manage containerized applications efficiently. It consists of a Control Plane (Master Node) and multiple Worker Nodes that execute the applications.
